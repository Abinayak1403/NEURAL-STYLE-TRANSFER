# 🖼️ Task 3 – Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow

This project is part of my **CodTech AI Internship**.  
The task focuses on applying an artistic style (from a painting) to a content image (like a photo), using a neural network.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a tool that:
- Accepts a **content image** and a **style image**
- Applies the style to the content using a pre-trained model
- Outputs a new, stylized image

---

## 🚀 How It Works

This project uses a pre-trained model from **TensorFlow Hub**:
- `arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256` for fast and beautiful results.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Accepts any JPEG or PNG image as content and style
- Generates high-quality stylized outputs
- Displays and saves the output image
- Can be run in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub pillow matplotlib
```

---

## 🧠 How to Run

You can use this script in either `.py` or `.ipynb` format.

### 📘 For Notebook (Recommended):
1. Open `NEURAL__STYLE__TRANSFER.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Run the cells step-by-step
3. Choose your own content and style images

---

## 🧪 Example

### 🖼️ Content Image:
`golden_gate.jpg`

### 🎨 Style Image:
`Vassily_Kandinsky,_1913_-_Composition_7.jpg`

### 🖌️ Output:
`figures.jpg` — the Golden Gate image in Kandinsky’s abstract painting style.
